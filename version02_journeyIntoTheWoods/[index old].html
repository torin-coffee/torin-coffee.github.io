                        In a land that can only be seen between passing dreams, only heard in the sounds of falling leaves and smelt in the pleasant smell of a warm meal after a long day, lived two brothers. I had the pleasure of meeting one of them a long time ago.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        These brothers lived on a farm on the edge of a great wood. Their father–like many others before and many others after–spent his time trying to subdue the land and build a life in the woods for his family. He cared much for his family and labored tirelessly. Every morning he would gather his tools into a wheelbarrow, pull a bucket of water from their well, and wheel his way into the woods to do his tasks.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Their mother was a kind woman who cared tenderly for a garden. She was a gentle woman who also cared for her animals. She would spend her day caring for her plants and nourishing each animal with more than food and water, but with love. She knew each animal by name, for she had spent her years naming them and they had each become a friend.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        She would hum songs as she carried her basket collecting her goods and chattel. When the sun would begin to set she would call out to her.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        This story is about their two sons. Jonathan was the oldest. He carried a small ax that was not all that sharp, no matter how many times he tried to sharpen it. He wore the branch of evergreen in his hair as good luck and clothes that had be    en patched many times. His younger brother’s name was David. He carried his mother’s handkerchief and a harp as he would sing songs to comfort himself when he got scared or excited. Their mother would often send her boys into the woods to gather special herbs and spices to be                 </p>

                        because he didn’t want to be left behind or considered less than. He became quite cross with himself that he was scared of some old forest. He made up his mind that he wouldn’t be scared of anything this old forest threw at him, for he was no baby he thought to himself. The two brothers stood at the edge of the forest waving goodbye to their mother. As they turned around and peered into the woods, David’s stomach sank and he felt as if he needed to sit down. Jonathan put his hand out and gave his brother a gentle push toward the forest.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The brothers walked along the forest brandishing sticks they’d found and passing the time fighting back plants and searching for mushrooms and berries. As they got deeper into the woods the woods began to get colder and darker, for the forest was dense and untamed. The sun shot through the branches along the path. The boys kept their eyes out for the right types of mushrooms, picking up rocks and searching around bushes. The boys could hear the noises of animals rustling through the bushes. Far off, the sound of an owl hooting kept tempo as the boys walked. David began kicking leaves as they moved along and sang out with his harp;

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Oh fearful forest, how you sing a chorus.
                        Your breath brings shivers down my spine,
                        as this walking takes so much time.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I wish that I was home, with the comfort of a fire.
                        Eating soup for Sunday dinner with a spoon,
                        With eyes that shine and shimmer in the moon

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A bed for when I tire, a kingdom where I’m the sire.
                        This is the object of the desire of my heart,
                        My dear Sunday soup.”

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The boys kept walking until the forest grew dark and the sun began to change colors. The fog started to emerge between the trees and spread its tendrils across the path. David pulled his cap tighter. The boys kept walking until they could hardly see the trail ahead of them.


                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Jonathan looked at David, seeing his eyes beginning to droop and his shoulders begin to slouch and decided that it would be a good time to stop. The two brothers worked together to build a fire, seeing who could carry the most sticks. To David’s dismay, Jonathan came back with his arms full with twice as many sticks in his arms as he had. Jonathan could hardly see over the stack of sticks he was carrying. The two lit a fire and sat in silence soaking up the warmth of its glow. Jonathan reached into the bag and pulled out a pair of apples and a jar of oatmeal and the two ate till they were full and sleep overtook them.


                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The two boys set out as soon as the sun came up. After walking all throughout the morning the two boys came upon a structure in the woods.

                        “Look!” Exclaimed Jonathan. “That’s the bridge into the Old Forest. But it looks as if part of the bridge has collapsed.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        David stared at the fallen section of the bridge and got that feeling in his stomach again. They both stood and peered across the bridge. It looked too far and too high for David to jump.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        David was about to say that they should find a different way but it was too late. Jonathan was already running and jumped across the gap. Jonathan turned around and let out a deep breath.

                        <br>
                        <br>“See David,” exclaimed Jonathan “Even a baby like you could do it.” David peered over the edge of the collapsed bridge and thought of the many times his mother had warned him of alligators deep in the forest that called these rivers home. David swallowed a small shriek before it could come out all the way.

        
                        <br>
                        <br>“You know I can’t! You just barely made it! And what if I fell in!” David shrieked in frustration. Neither of the brothers had learned how to swim for they had grown up to be cautious of any body of water, as they were warned of the vicious alligators that crept from water source to water source.


                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “You should just stay here,” said Jonathan “and I’ll go grab the salt and come back.”
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Father told us we need to stay together.” Argued David with a tinge of panic in his voice.

        
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        “It will only be a few hours,” explained Jonathan. “The mine is not too much farther.” Jonathan couldn’t remember how far it was exactly but wanted to settle his brother’s nerves so he could go exploring in the deep woods.

        
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        “But..” David said but was cut short.
        
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        “Just stay here and I’ll be back by nightfall,” Jonathan said, already walking away.

        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        David looked around the clearing. It wasn’t a bad clearing. But it was no fun to be left behind. He went over by the river and started looking for stones to skip. After poking around in the mud he saw something glimmer in the grime of the river water. He rolled up his pant legs and looked around for alligators. He slipped off his shoes and waded into the river. He poked around in the river to see if he could feel something buried in the mud. He felt a clunk. He reached into the water and felt his hands wrap around something hard and kinda pointy. He started pulling something out of the water. As he pulled it out and the water washed the mud away he could see that it was a picture frame. As he looked closer he saw it was a mirror. He finished washing all the dirt off it and stepped back onto the bank. He stared into the mirror and saw himself staring back. But then the mirror began to change and he began to see his mother making Sunday Soup in a big brown pot over a roaring fire. His stomach began to grumble. The apple from the night before was slowly fleeting.

                    “What kind of mirror is this?” David wondered. He finished scrubbing the rest of the frame and placed it in his bag.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    David explored the clearing and got bored. He tried the usual things to pass the time and found tic-tac-toe was no fun with one person, stone skipping was a lot harder once one ran out of stones. He tried climbing a tree but got covered in sap and got a splinter in his hand.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “Oh, how bothersome is a game with only one player.
                    The hours of a day pass like weeks at a time.
                    

                    <br>
                    Oh, how bothersome is splinter in the hand.
                    Only sap seems to stick by my side.
                    

                    <br>
                    <br>Oh, bother—”

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “My song is bumming me out.” Sighed David as his shoulders slumped. Not even music was making him feel better.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So he picked himself up and walked to the edge of the river.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “Maybe I can find another spot to cross the river and Jonathan won’t think I’m such a baby.” Thought David. So he set out to walk up the river and find a way across.


                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sitting on the edge of the river was an alligator, bathing in a spot of sun. David crept quietly, careful not to step on anything that would make a sound. David’s heart pounded as he crept behind the bushes.


                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “I can smell you, there’s no point in hiding,” came a deep voice from the alligator. David froze.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “Maybe he was bluffing.” Thought David with his heart pounding. He held his breath and hoped he was bluffing. His heart pounded in his ears and his head felt dizzy.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “I can tell that you’re holding your breath. Come out and let me see you boy.” Said the alligator in its deep voice. “You don’t have to worry, I just ate, and don’t like human meat all that much anyway.”

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    David emerged from the bush tentatively. The alligator gave him a once over with his eyes.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “No need to keep holding your breath.” Said the alligator. David let out his breath in one big gasp. “What brings you to deep woods child?”

                <p>
                    David emerged from the bush tentatively. The alligator gave him a once over with his eyes.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “No need to keep holding your breath.” Said the alligator. David let out his breath in one big gasp. “What brings you to deep woods child?”
                    <br> 
                    <br>David paused. He didn’t know if he should say anything. Maybe he should just run. His heart was still pounding. It didn’t matter what the alligator said, if he was hungry, David was dinner. David’s mind raced, but nothing he thought up seemed like it would work. He had heard something about running zig zags, but that seemed like a worst-case scenario.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“Me and my brother—my brother and I—came to gather mushrooms and collect salt from the mine in the deep forest.” David was learning grammar, and even in this instance, his mother’s lessons came to mind.
                    The alligator’s eyes narrowed. “So where is this brother of yours?” Ask the alligator with suspicion.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David thought if maybe he should lie and say his brother was right behind him and had an ax. Maybe he could scare him.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    As if he could hear his thoughts the alligator spoke. “Don’t lie to me, for my nose is strong and can even smell lies on someone’s breath.”
                    David gulped. “He went ahead of me. The bridge collapsed and I couldn’t cross. He jumped across and told me to wait behind. He said he’d be back soon with the salt.” That wasn’t fully a lie though David.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “But the mime is a day’s journey past the bridge if you’re fully grown. And I can still smell him on you, which means he hasn’t been gone long. Are you fearful of me child?”


                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    David answered, “Should I be?”

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    The alligator let out a chuckle deep from his throat. “You are wise to be, but there is no need, for I do not see many humans this deep in the woods and I have no taste for them.”


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David felt a little better but had no reason to believe him.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“Would you like me to take you across?” Offered the alligator. “It would be no trouble. Like I said, I don’t get to see many humans this deep in the woods. I only ask that you help me clean my teeth. For I have something stuck between my teeth that I cannot get out. My friend the Egyptian Plover bird usually cleans my teeth, but he is gone for the season. I only ask you to use your fingers and pull the thing out.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “How can I trust that you won’t just dump me in the water and eat me once we part ways?” Questioned David. For that was the nature of alligators. They were known to be tricksters. They would sometimes pretend to be stuck and cry, tricking people into thinking they need help. As soon as people got too close they would sink they’re teeth into their victim. It allowed for the sign maker to become quite wealthy with the amount of signage about the treacherous alligators.

                    “Tell me your name.” Asked David. For David knew that the first step in any friendship, even one with an alligator, was learning a name.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The alligator grinned, showing off his treacherous smile. “I am called many things by many things. You may call me serenity.”


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Your name is serenity?” Said David with a lack of belief. “An alligator named serenity?” He thought to himself. Serenity was the state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled. An alligator with such a name?


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Yes. It is the name I have chosen in my old age. I am old, even for an alligator. My years number more than I have been able to keep track of. I now lie in wait for serenity. That is why I call myself serenity.”


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    This alligator seemed to have a way with words. He started asking himself if he could actually trust an alligator. “Well serenity, my name is David. I am not yet in double digits, and I did not get to choose my name. I want to trust you so that I can cross the river, but I know with one bite you could rip me to pieces.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I guess we are at an impasse.” Said Serenity. “I only wish to rid myself of this terrible pain.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David thought for a second. “How can I know if I can trust him?” He then remembered the mirror. He pulled it from his bag and looked into it. It showed him on the other side of the river. Safe and sound. “The mirror must show what the viewer wants.” Discovered David. He looked at the mirror and pointed it towards serenity.


                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    Serenity peered curiously into it and it began to change. It showed a piece of bone buried deep in the alligator’s gum and a pair of hands slowly pulling it from its entrenchment. Serenity’s eyes widened, his jaw was slightly ajar.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “This mirror tells what a person most wants. If I promise to do this thing for you, do you promise to give me safe passage across the river?” Bartered David.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I promise that I will deliver you safely to the other side.” Said Serenity.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Ok. I trust you.” Said David with half-hearted confidence. The hair stood up on his neck as he slowly approached the alligator.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “You may step on my back.” Said serenity turning to face the water. David stepped on his back. He could feel the hard scales of his back and see scars from his years of living. David stood there, heart pounding. “It will be just a moment.” And then submerged quickly into the water leaving just a small portion of himself above the water for David. They began crossing the river. David could tell the current was strong by the way Serenity kicked hard against it. They swam somewhat diagonally across the river. They quickly crossed over and Serenity carried them to shore. David stepped off his back onto the muddy bank. His shoes fell deep into the mud. Serenity stared at David.

                    “Now for your part of the deal.” Serenity said and opened his jaw wide
                    <br> 
                    <br>David could see the bone digging deep into his gum. He hesitantly reached into the powerful jaw of his new acquaintance. Each of his teeth looked like daggers, the slightest touch pricked his finger drawing blood. His fingers found the bone at the base of the tooth. He began to twist and pull it out. Serenity’s jaws clenched and David thought to withdraw his hand but kept pulling. The tooth began to loosen and with a pop came right out. Blood started to flow out from the wound. David quickly ripped a piece of cloth from his coat and pressed it to the gums around the exposed wound. Slowly the blood began to slow and the wound closed up. David took the cloth and washed it in the river. Wringing it out till it was mostly dry.


                    <br> 
                    <br>Serenity thanked the young boy who had delivered him from such terrible pain. Serenity hadn’t realized how much his tooth had ached till the pain was gone.

                    <br> 
                    <br>He told David, “If you ever need anything at all, I am in great debt to you for a small river crossing is nothing compared to the freedom you’ve given me. I do leave you with one warning though, there is something worse than alligators in these woods. There is a human-like thing that lurks around these woods. He walks on two legs but he is not like you. He does not wear a face nor does he seem to eat as we would. He lurks in the shadows and watches. He lives in pain, a product of his curse. Beware young one, and stay safe.” David nodded his head and waved goodbye. David began to follow what looked like a path that led deeper into the forest. After about half an hour, he suddenly let out a deep breath and bent over with his hand on his knees. He couldn’t believe that he was still in one piece. A part of him hoped that he would never meet another alligator again—but at the same time—a part of him, a much warmer and sentimental part, wanted to see Serenity again. For his words were actually quite gentle and his intentions earnest. David took out his harp and sang.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “What joy is it to be in one piece!
                    <br> 
                    For my Arms are meant to swing
                    <br> 
                    And legs to love to run!

                    <br> 
                    My eyes can see, how plain it be
                    <br> 
                    That a body is best, connected to a chest and in one piece!
                    

                    <br> 
                    <br>Oh forest, do you know what it is like to walk?
                    <br> 
                    I would explain it if you could talk,
                    <br> 
                    Or write it with some chalk
                    <br> 
                    <br> I have legs
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    David took a deep breath and smiled. With new determination, he set forward.
                    The sun made its way across the sky while David made progress on his own journey.“I wonder if the sun ever gets tired.” Thought David. “It must be because he goes to sleep every night.” The thought of the sun sleeping made David realize just how tired he was. He had been walking almost the whole day. The time before the bridge felt so long ago. He had hoped that the trail would have met up with a wider trail that connected to the bridge. But it had just kept going. David began to get nervous and his heart began to pound. Fear gripped him. He remembered what his father had told him to do in these situations
                    
                    <br> 
                    <br> Take a deep breath.
                    Slow your thoughts and stay calm.
                    Think of some solutions and act.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He concentrated on the thought of Sunday soup and his breath began to slow. He took deep breaths. He knew the way back, he could always turn around. The sun was setting to his right in the west, which meant he was walking south parallel to the other trail. If he turned and walked toward the sun he should be able to meet up with the other trail. David pushed his way off the path he had followed and into the unknown. The woods were dense and hard to push through. He could barely see the sun through everything in his way.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    After a time of walking the sun slowly started to dip behind the distant mountains. He still hadn’t made it to the trail and once the sun set he would not be able to tell which direction he was going. He spied a fallen tree, hallowed out after years of sitting. He peered inside and found it to be a satisfactory home for the night. He set his harp down and bundled his bag as a pillow. There was nothing he could do now but sleep and hope he found the trail the next morning. With that as his last thought, he fell asleep to the sounds of the woods

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    A figure stood above him, its silhouette standing out in the lift of the moon. Waiting.

                    Meanwhile, on the other side of the forest, the older brother Jonathan had quite an unusual day as well. After parting ways with his younger brother he began to explore the forest as he walked. He eventually came to a giant rock covered in green moss. He could see that it was very climbable and bet he could see the whole first from the top. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>He approached the rock. Seeing a way up he quickly set work and in no time at all was reaching for the last hold at the top of the rock. Pulling himself to the top he stood up. Looking around he could see almost the whole forest. He smiled in amazement. Taking in the scenery his eyes fell upon something in the distance. It looked like the cone of a roof or a clock tower. 


                    <br> 
                    <br>He studied it but it was just far enough that couldn’t quite make it out. He looked around for landmarks that could guide him to whatever it was deep in the woods. The woods were too thick to see anything at first but his eyes soon fell upon a pile of rocks in the distance and what looked like the bend of the river leading to a fallen tree. It looked like a straight shot to the rocks and then to the river. He could just follow the river until got to the tree and just follow the direction in which the tree had fallen. He tried to judge how many steps it should take to get to each landmark and commit it to memory. He made his way down the mossy rock in the golden light. Once he got to the bottom, he found his direction and headed toward the rocks.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    After a short time, he quickly found himself in a pile of rocks. He judged the river to be a couple of thousand paces away from where he was at the rocks. He lined himself up with the top of the boulder protruding from the distant trees. He held out his hands to form a line pointing in the direction he should go. He set forward towards the river.

                    <br> 
                    <br>It must have been farther than he realized because he had walked far more than a couple of miles. He scolded himself for misjudging the distance. Maybe he shouldn’t have veered so far off the path. He could no longer see the boulder because of the way the trees blotted out the sky. He walked until he could hear the sounds of the river. He rushed forward eager to see the sight of the river and make knowing that he was on track.

                    <br> 
                    <br>He emerged from the trees and found himself at the river’s bend. He let out a sigh of relief. His intuition has been right. The fallen tree was right in front of him pointing the way to an unknown object in the woods. He lined himself up in the direction the tree was pointing and took off once again into the depths of the forest, swallowed up by its size.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    He soon found himself at the edge of a prairie deep in the woods. The woods framed it in shades of orange, green, and brown. Dead in the center of the prairie was an old stone fire lookout. The square edges were textured with stone leading up to a slightly wider spire at the top of the tower. The roof was green with moss. Patches grew all up and down the tower making it appear spotted with greens and browns. The field was full of tall grass. It looked parched.

                    Jonathan ran his hands over the grass as he walked across the field. Till he reached the base of the tower. He curiously marched around the base of the tower looking for a door. He spotted the outline of an entrance but it looked as if it had been closed. He couldn’t see a way in. He could use a rope to try and climb up but he had left the bag with David. 

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    So he sat down on a rock beside the tower and began to contemplate ideas that could get him into the tower. He sat on his rock and began throwing rocks to see if he could get one through one of the windows at the top of the towers. The first one fell too short. He threw 2 more which also gave up before they could reach the window. He picked up a fourth and whispered a bit of encouragement to it so that it would try it would go extra high. He cocked his arm behind his head and twisted his hips and with a big grunt threw it as hard as he could. The rock flew from his hand towards the window of the tower. This one did not give up, his encouragement must have worked. It sailed between the four frames of the tower and landed with a yelp. A yelp?

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “Hey!” A figure emerged by the window. A girl around his age stood by the window peering down and rubbing her head. Her dark hair was braided with little bits of gold in it. “Did you throw that rock?” She asked with a tinge of curiosity and contempt.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “Oh, dear.” Exclaimed Jonathan “Uh–yes mam.” He didn’t know what to call her. Miss? He debated between mom and little girl. Neither seemed right but he didn’t want to offend her more so he went with mam.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Why did you throw a rock at me?” Asked the girl.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “I didn’t throw it at you, I threw it just to throw it.” Said Jonathan.


                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    All of a sudden he saw her toss the rock out of the tower and back at him. Jonathan jumped out of the way.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “Why did you throw that rock at me?” Exclaimed Jonathan with frustration.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “Just to throw it.” Said the girl before she walked back into the tower.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    Jonathan was still a little angry but thought that was fair enough. “Hey!” Called Jonathan again. He sat there waiting for a response. “Hello?” Called Jonathan again. Nothing. Jonathan picked up another rock and threw it just as he had done the first time. This time it sailed through the window with a clunk. A figure appeared at the window.

                    <br>

                    “That was on purpose.” Said the girl. “Why are you throwing rocks through my window?”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “What is this place?” Said Jonathan out of curiosity.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “It’s an old fire lookout. They used to send volunteers out here during dry seasons to watch for fires, but nobody has been here for a long time.”


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “How did you get up there?” Asked Jonathan, slowly becoming more curious about the situation.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I climbed. Well, not just me. My friend Mr. Foxwell showed me how to climb the tower. He is well-versed in many things and is quite nimble. What’s your name?” Asked the girl.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Oh yeah–haha, my name is Jonathan.” Jonathan had been so busy thinking about how he could climb up the tower he forgot to ask her name. “Sorry, I was being impolite. What is your name?”



                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I would say it’s nice to meet you, and you seem pleasant enough, but you did throw two rocks at me and that made me unhappy.” Said the girl.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I’m sorry!” Apologized Jonathan quickly. “I let my curiosity and excitement about the tower overtake my better judgment. I’m glad you think I’m pleasant. You seem quite nice yourself. Please tell me your name, so maybe we can become friends.”


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “My name is Catalina. Please don’t call me Cat, for that gets confusing for Ms. Cat. You may call me Layna if you wish.” Said Layna. “I have some rope, can you climb it if I throw some down?”


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Yes. I’m a good climber, at least I try to be. Throw it down and we’ll see.” Said Jonathan. A loop of rope fell from the tower in a bundle and unwound hitting the ground with a thump. He began climbing the rope and quickly climbed to the edge of the window squeezing his way into the tower.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “He looked around. There was a pile of grass in the center of the room which looked like a bed. Light spilled in from each side. The interior was rocky. The roof still looked in good condition from the inside. All of a sudden Jonathan got a chill. He looked around, not knowing what had caused it.



                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “He must be nearby.” Said Layna.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Who?” Said Jonathan.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I don’t know his name, but he looks like a man without a face. Mr. Foxwell says he saw him once during the harvest moon. He roams the forest watching and waiting. I’ve never seen him, but you can feel him. His gaze is cold and his presence is like the winter. He consumes animals whole and moves with darkness. Mr. Foxwell thinks that he was a man of magic driven mad by his own sorcery, but he has no proof and I think he just likes people to think he knows more than he does.” Rambled Layna. “Does anyone call you Jon?”

                    “My Mom does sometimes.” Said Jonathan. 

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I’m gonna call you Jon.” Said Layna.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Jonathan didn’t know if he should be mad about the nickname or not, so he chose to think of it as a term of endearment.
                    

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “It’s not a term of endearment. It’s for convenience.” Said Layna bluntly, reading his mind.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Jonathan decided he wouldn’t believe her and take it as a token of friendship. He peered out the window looking for a shadowy figure without a face but only saw leaves falling from the trees and began to worry about his younger brother. He shouldn’t have left him. “Do you know how far the salt mine is from here? The bridge collapsed and my brother couldn’t jump over the gap in the bridge so he stayed behind. See, I’m worried about it. I’m not scared, but I don’t want him to be.” He lied. He was actually quite nervous and it showed on his face. Layna laughed a little under her breath, for it was clear that he was trying to sound brave.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “If you’re worried about him I’ll send a pigeon to Mr. Foxwell and he’ll find him and let him know about the situation. It’s his day off and he usually hunts for frogs for his frog soup. He’ll find your brother no problem.” Said Layna. She crossed the room and opened a small clay jar that had been glazed with a shiny blue vitreous substance.

                    vitreous

                    <br>
                    She pulled out what looked to be a bunch of seeds. She walked over to the window and held out her hand. She then made a spot on the pigeon calls. It came out as a string of coos that had a slight syncopation to them

                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Jonathan had been spending too much time in the dictionary and had started getting carried away with his word choice. He heard the sound of wings oscillating. Fluttering into view was a small pigeon with a blue head and beautiful green and purple going down its neck. Layna whispered into its ear as it ate the seeds in her hand. She then gave it a few pets and the pigeon flew away.

                    “No need to worry. My friend Mr. Foxwell is quite crafty and has a knack for finding things. He’ll take good care of your brother. Now about the salt mine.” Said Layna. “I can take you there. There’s a tunnel that leads into the mine not far from here. I’ll lead you to it.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Jonathan, now Jon, nodded his head in agreement. “Thank you.”

                    <br>
                    “Yes!” Said Jon as he quickly moved to the edge of the window. The two climbed down. She was a quick climber and made easy work of the tall climb. Jon–who considered himself a great climber–was quite impressed. She leads the way across the field and the two entered the woods.

                    David woke up from his place in the log to a foggy morning. His body was quaking from the cold. He had been too tired to make a fire and regretted it now. He decided it was best to get moving and warm himself up, so he got up from his spot on the log and stretched out his arms giving a big yawn.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He looked around the clearing. He had no idea which way he should go. He couldn’t even see the outline of the sun. His stomach growled. He needed to find something to eat. He had been hungry since yesterday and now the hunger had started to dig its teeth into him. It made him feel sick. He began walking in search of berries or nuts to eat. He wandered around the trees till he found a blackberry bush. The berries were out of season and tasted old and bitter. He continued walking till he was able to find a wild apple tree. All the apples near the bottom were rotten or partially eaten. He studied the tree searching for a good apple.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    Suddenly his eyes stopped searching as an apple near the top of the tree appeared. It gleamed in the early morning light. Even in the fog, it appeared like the sun. It was the most beautiful apple he had ever seen. He walked around the tree till he found a way to climb up. He made his way up in the tree, careful which branches he grabbed in case they were rotten. He had climbed high in the tree till the apple was just out of reach. He stared at the apple. His stomach growled. He reached out as far as he could, but it was out of reach. All he could do was look at it. It teased him swaying in the wind. At least he wasn’t cold now. He stubbornly stared at it, his eyebrows ablaze with contempt.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He looked down at the ground. It was covered in soft moss and the soil was good and soft. An idea popped into his head. He perched from his spot in the tree. He looked into the soul of the apple and coiled himself like a spring. He jumped as far as and as hard as he could. His body sprung into the air, his arms outstretched grabbing towards the apple. His fingertips touched the corners of the apple but he was just short. He began tumbling through the air toward the ground. He waved his arms trying to remain upright. He landed with a thump and an accidental role–which might have saved him from hurting himself in the fall. He sat dazed holding up his empty hands when something hit him on the head. It was the apple.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    David sat and gratefully ate the apple. It tasted better than it looked. It was crisp and cold, and tasted sweeter than honey. He ate the apple till there was nothing left around the core and seeds were revealed. He took the seeds and wrapped them in some cloth and put them back into his bag. He planned to plant the apple as soon as he made it home. An apple so perfect should not go to waste, It deserved to be planted and turned into a tree.

                    He got up from his spot at the base of the tree and looked around. He couldn’t see anything in the thickness of the fog. He quickly realized how lost he had become. In his tiredness and hunger, he had wandered deeper into the forest without thinking and had lost complete direction.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He suddenly realized that he was shivering from the cold. He took deep breaths and tried formulating a plan. He decided to keep walking and see if he could make his way back to the river. He was partially sure that if he could make it back to the river he could follow it back up to the bridge. He continued walking trying to slow down his breath. He didn’t have any idea how he was going to find the river. He started to get nervous again. He took a deep breath and started to sing.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Oh forest, you have swallowed me up like a blueberry
                    <br> 
                    And have become dark and scary.
                    <br> 
                    But I will not let you digest me!
                    

                    <br> 
                    <br>Oh forest, you think you have gotten the best of me
                    <br> 
                    But I am clever as a bee!
                    <br> 
                    I will not grow old here!
                    <br> 
                    
                    

                    <br> 
                    <br>Oh forest,  I’m not scared although you growl like a bear
                    <br> 
                    Even if I do not know here from there.
                    <br> 
                    Tis just a small burden to carry!”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    A voice came from the darkness and made David jump his height into the air. David screeched in terror. “It is not the forest’s job to keep you from getting lost.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Hello? Who’s there? Are you friend or foe?” Said David holding his harp like a weapon.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I cannot tell you if we are friends or enemies because I do not know you.” Said the voice.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Do you mean harm to me?” Said David.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Is there a reason you might deserve harm?” Said the voice.
                    
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I don’t think so. Why don’t you show yourself so I can see you?” Peering into the fog.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I cannot. You must reveal yourself to me.” Said the voice. “If you step forward you may see me with more clarity.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David tentatively stepped forward. He wondered if this was some kind of trap. It could be some wild animal waiting to pounce, or some cleverly laid trap, like a hole that if he steps too close too he might fall in and be unable to climb out of. He stepped forward with caution, watching out for traps. All of a sudden a massive tree loomed from within the fog. David looked at it in amazement. It had branches that grew so high he could not see where they went. He looked around for where the voice might be coming from. He knew that some animals not yet overcome by wildness retained the ability to talk. But he had never seen any for they usually lived deep within the forest.

                    “Hello? Are you there?” Questioned David into the fog.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“Do you not see me? I am right in front of you.” Said the voice. It had a deep voice that sounded gruff from age. The voice was coming from the tree. David looked at the tree with amazement. As he approached it, he could see it had a face. It had eyes hidden under deep eyebrows and a nose that grew out like a branch. Its mouth looked like it was hidden within a beard. His face looked tired and worn.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“Do you see me now?” Said the tree in its greatness.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“Yes, I can. You are a beautiful tree. I didn’t know there were trees that could talk.” Said David inquisitively.
                    
                    <br> 
                    <br>“All trees talk young one. They groan when the wind blows trying to remain upright. They express themselves with all kinds of leaves and colors. They give gifts of fruits to the forest around them. They inhale and exhale just like you.” Said the tree. “But you are speaking of trees that speak the language of man. Yes, there are seldom few.” Said the great Tree. “I have not heard a complicated melody like yours in these woods before. I enjoy the music of the birds and the tenacious melodies of the wind mostly.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>“How do you talk? If it’s ok I ask.” Asked David.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“That is an answer I do not know. ” Said the great tree.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“Do you know directions back to the fallen bridge?” Asked David.

                    <br> 
                    <br>“HMMM.” Boomed the great tree. The leaves on the tree swayed and groaned as if being strained. The ground shook a little under David’s feet and he almost fell to the ground.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “I do not know it. Tell me where you’ve come from and how you got here, then maybe I can give you directions.” Said the great tree.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David told him the whole story of his time in the woods, from when he first left his parent’s house to when he had wandered to that apple tree. The tree patiently listened. David explained that if he could get to the river he could get over to the bridge.


                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “HMMM.” Sighed the great tree. “Yes, I know the river. HMMM. The river, yes. It has many turns that the river does. Where is it now? It’s always moving that river.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David listened intently, hoping the tree would be able to give him directions.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “HMMM.” Said the tree in thought again. “Rivers, yes, moving. You want to move like a river. I cannot teach you to move like a river.”

                    “I don’t want to MOVE like a river! I need directions TO the river.” Said David a little agitated. This tree was a slow thinker. He thought.

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “HMMM.” Said the tree. “Directions. Yes.” The ground shook and the great tree creaked and groaned. “Yes, the river in the west. I do know it. You’d like to see it move? No, no, directions. The young human wants directions. Give me just a short moment. The tree creaked as his eyes began to close. Soon the great tree was silent. David sat down and waited for him to wake up.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    Some time passed as the tree continued to think. David began to wonder if the tree even knew his question, let alone the answer. David sat on the ground and strummed his harp, waiting for the tree to wake up. Time continued to pass and David began to grow tired. Hours passed and soon David found his eyes drooping and he fell asleep.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    Suddenly the ground began to shake and David awoke to the sounds of groaning wood. He woke up and looked back at the tree. The tree began to open his eyes.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “I have conversed with woods and they have decided to help you. Follow the falling leaves till you reach the river, then follow the river south till you reach the bridge. I appreciated your song, young one, if the wind is ever blowing east, play a song and the wind will bring it to me.” Said the tree. “Now, be off with you. You may reach the river just after nightfall if you hurry now. Farewell.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    David thanked the tree for his help and waved farewell. The fog had begun burning off in the midday sun. He looked up to see leaves falling from the trees and began heading in their direction.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    After a few hours of walking, David felt a chill run down his spine and could feel the eyes of something watching him. He began to hurry his way through the woods, following the falling leaves. The faster he moved the faster the eyes seemed to keep up with him. He began to run as fast as he could and could hear something chasing after him. He could hear it slowly gaining on him until it was right behind him. He turned around and swung his bag as hard as he could, hoping to connect with whatever was chasing him. A blur ducked under the bag and grabbed him tackling him to the ground with a thud. He looked up to see a fox pinning him to the ground. He struggled against the grip of the fox, weaseling his way from its grip and clawing his way over to his bag. The two stared at each other. The fox sneered at him.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    The fox stood up and looked him in the eyes. “Is your name David?”
                    
                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “Yes, my name is David,” said David with confusion.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    Oh, I’ve been looking for you.” Said the fox.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Looking for me, why?” It felt like he was doing a lot more than just looking. The eyes of the Fox were tactical, David felt as if his every inch was being studied and accessed. He could see plans forming behind his eyes. He wasn't fond of having a friend like this fox.

                    “Your brother asked me to find you. Sorry about tackling you. I’m not usually like that, I think I might be coming down with something.” Apologized the fox to David. “Your brother asked me to find and bring you to the salt mine. I wasn’t feeling like it, but here you are, so I might as well take you to the mine. I do owe that girl a favor.” Said the Fox.  

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “My brother asked you to find me?” Asked David suspiciously.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Technically a pigeon did. Gave up its life to send that message.” Said the fox. coughing up a feather. “Don’t worry kid, I promise I’ll take you to your brother, dead or alive. Probably alive, I don’t know why I said that.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    This fox seemed like bad news.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Could you just tell me the directions?” Asked David. “I can take care of myself.”
                    
                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “But you can’t jump over a small gap in a bridge? Anyway, that’s not the issue. The issue is that I need to take you there so that she will forgive my debt.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    David had so many questions, he didn’t know where to start.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Just stick with me, I know this forest better than anyone.”

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    David tried to think of an excuse not to, but the fox was already leaving.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “If we hurry we can stop and get dinner!” Exclaimed the Fox excitedly.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    David was already hungry from the apple earlier. Dinner did sound good. His stomach growled in agreement and it didn’t sound like he was going to be the main course. 

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Are you coming?” Said the fox poking his head out from behind a tree and then ducking back behind.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    David followed the fox, trying his best to keep up. This fox was fast. He could barely keep up, even with the fox waiting for him every few minutes.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Come on kid, try and keep up!” Said the fox.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    David picked up his pace and continued running after the nimble fox. After what must have been over an hour the fox stopped. David almost ran into him, wheezing for breath. The fox was looking into a clearing. On the other side of the clearing was a cave.

                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    “Is that the mine?” Asked David.

                <p>“The mine? No, of course not. Don’t be silly.” Said the fox. “That’s a bear cave.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Why are we stopped outside a bear cave?”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “We need dinner, don’t we? Try to keep up.” Said the fox.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Okay…”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Ok, do I have to explain this to you?” Said the fox staring into his eyes. “I’m gonna have to explain this to you. Ugh. Ok, here’s the deal *snap* *snap*, eyes here, look at me. In that cave is a bear. Don’t worry he’s hibernating. In that cave is all the food that the bear has stored up for the winter. All you gotta do is gointo that cave and grab it. Easy.” Said the fox pushing David toward the cave.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “No wa–”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “It’s easy, it’s done all the time. The bear doesn’t even want it. It’s already eaten all it can for the winter. It’s probably so deep into its hibernation it won’t even know you’re there. If there are sarsaparilla berries, try and grab a couple handfuls.” Said the fox pushing him again towards the cave’s entrance. “Come on kid, I can tell you’re hungry from here. You’re wasting away in front of my eyes.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David’s stomach growled right at that moment. David begrudgingly entered the cave. It was dark and damp. A slight breeze blew from the depths of the cave. He felt his way along the wall as his eyes slowly adjusted to the dark.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He continued to walk until he stepped on something soft. He bent down to feel what he had stepped on. It felt like a berry. It felt like a sarsaparilla berry. He bent down and began putting handfuls into his bag. After slowly crawling along the ground picking up handful after handful of berries he walked deeper into the cave till he tripped over something in the dark and fell onto a patch of grass.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He stood up and picked up his bag as he looked up, he saw two eyes appear in the darkness. His heart froze. It felt like the wind had been knocked out of him. A line of jagged teeth grew out of the darkness and growls started to form. David stumbled back and fell onto his bag. A shadow seemed to rise up from the darkness, looming over him. Two eyes stared down at him with intensity. He let out a gulp. He heard a deep growl grow from the darkness. He was frozen in fear. He felt around in the dark and accidentally ran his fingers down his harp letting out a sweet sound into the cave.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The bear growled, but not the same fearsome growl as before. David wondered if maybe all the bear wanted was something to help it fall asleep. So he grabbed his harp and started to strum. The teeth slowly started to recede into the dark. David began to sing.

                    “Please do not eat me mighty bear,
                    may sleep come to you instead.
                    Go back and lie in your bed,
                    for there is no good food here.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Go to sleep little bear,
                    And leave all your cares till the spring
                    Your eyes are heavy and your arms are tired.
                    Let your eyelids droop and close your eyes
                    Go to sleep, little bear.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The bear’s eyes began to droop and David heard it sit back on its bed. David started to get more into the song as he saw it doing its magic.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Oh beautiful bear, do not fear.
                    Let dreams invade your mind’s eye.
                    Season of rest, your mind be clear,
                    Tell your worries begone and goodbye.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Go to sleep little bear,
                    And leave all your cares till the spring
                    Your eyes are heavy and your arms are tired.
                    Let your eyelids droop and close your eyes
                    Go to sleep, little bear.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The bear began to snore. David grabbed as many berries as he could carry and sprinted out of the cave. The fox greeted him on the outside of the cave.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “What happened?” asked the fox, peeking into David’s bag. “I thought you were dead for sure!” Already grabbing a handful of berries from the bag as David pulled it away from him.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “The bear was NOT asleep. It was very much awake. I thought you said you did this all the time?” Said David accusingly.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I said it was done all the time. Usually by rats and sometimes by squirrels. I would never do it, but look at you! You did it! Have as many berries as you like, you earned them!” Said the fox.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Of course, I can have as many as I want, I was the one who grabbed them.” Thought David in frustration.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Alright, now that we got that out of the way, let’s get to that mine.” Said the fox as he began leaping away into the woods. “Are you coming?” Said the fox poking his head out from behind a tree and then ducking back behind.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David sighed and began running after him.

                    Jon followed Layna till they reached the main road. They walked down the road talking about their favorite knots. They had talked about their favorite season, Jon’s, being summer because he liked to be outside. Layna agreed. They both shared the tallest things they had climbed. Layna said she had climbed one of the tallest trees in the forest. A big tree with what she described as eyes on one side. Jon said he climbed a mountain, but she didn’t believe him. Truthfully, he hadn’t, so admitted that he hadn’t actually climbed a mountain, but he hoped to one day. They continued walking till they ran out of favorite things and objects they had climbed. The two walked in silence. Jon started to think of his younger brother, hoping he was ok. Layna thought about many things, none of any real importance, just things that popped into her mind. The two walked further, caught up in their own thoughts till Layna pointed.
                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    “There it is! The mine!” She said, holding out her hand in the direction of the hillside with a hole in the side leading deep within. The doorway was propped up with wood. A torch lay bundled at the entrance of the cave.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The two of them approached the entrance feeling a cool breeze from within the mine. Layna Picked up the torch. It was a long wooden stick with some cloth at the end. The cloth was caked in thick oil. Layne quickly hit two rocks together and lit the torch.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The two of them entered the mine. The mine was deeper than Jon had remembered. The air grew cold and the entrance to the mine soon faded into a memory. The two continued to walk deeper into the cave. The two of them walked a ways farther till they finally reached a white room that had been carved out from the rock in the mine. The room was a giant deposit of salt. Pillars stood throughout the room. One might even call it a cavern because it was so large. Probably over a hundred pillars stood within the cavern. At the center of the cavern was an array of mirrors that bounced light into the cave from a hole in the ceiling.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Jon pulled out his hatchet and walked over to a pillar. He scraped some salt from one of the pillars into a jar. He packed the jar into his coat and turned to face Layna. He was about to say something but Layna had her finger to her lips. Jon stood looking around. The two of them faced each other.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    She quickly ran over to him and pulled him over behind a pillar. The two of them peered around the corners of the pillar. A cold wind blew in from the entrance they had come in. They watched the entrance intently. The air began to smell mold and decay. Jon wrinkled his nose. It smelt of old lettuce and moldy potatoes. He pinched his nose, his mouth twisting in disgust. Slowly but surely The smell grew stronger and stronger. Layna slowly put out the flame and pressed herself tighter to the pillar.

                    Jon kept his eyes glued to the entrance. He could start to see a figure start emerging from the tunnel. Long hands wrapped themselves around the doorway of the tunnel. They were pale and wrinkled. The sound of muffled grunts started coming from the entrance. A shiver ran down Jon’s spine and his heart began pumping heavily in his chest. He tried to hide but he couldn’t look away. A long white head emerged from the cave’s entrance.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Layna let out a stifled shriek. The thing emerged from the tunnel. It was tall. It had to bend on all fours to fit into the tunnel. It slowly spread itself out, standing straight up in the cavern. It had long thin arms and legs. They looked too long for its body. Long nails grew out jaggedly from its hands. Its body was round. It was dressed in black clothes that were worn out. Parts looked thin, held together by string. Attached to its neck was a white wrinkly head. It looked wet with sweat. It was white and droopy. It had no spot for eyes, no nose protruding from it. There were sounds where a mouth should be but no mouth. Muffled shrieks and groans came from it as it walked. Its hands wrapped around everything it touched.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David pulled his head back behind the pillar, terrified. The thing didn’t seem to be able to see. It was touching everything like a blind man might touch something to understand it. David could hear the quiet whine of its joints moving as it moved around the cavern searching. David realized he was breathing heavily. He took a deep breath, remembering what his father had told him.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Take a deep breath.
                    Slow your thoughts and stay calm.
                    Think of some solutions and act.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    He saw it moving away from the entrance. He knelt down and grabbed a rock. He felt the weight of it in his hand. He cocked his arm back and threw the rock with his whole body. The rock flew over the monster’s body and over its head and across the cavern, smacking against the wall on the other side. The monster cocked his head and let out a big shriek. It stood on all fours and started furiously making its way toward the sound. It carefully touched each surface as it moved.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Layna grabbed Jon’s hand and pulled him towards the entrance. The two ran through the blackness of the cave tripping on rocks and helping each other up. They heard a shriek from within the tunnel. They began running even faster, feeling their way down the walls, unable to see anything. All they heard were more muffled shrieks coming from deeper in the tunnel.

                    The two kept moving in the dark. The sounds kept getting closer and closer till they could hear the sounds of wet hands on cave walls and muffled breathing. The air grew putrid with the smell of mold. Jon was breathing heavily his eyes wide with terror. He kept running as fast as he could. The sounds kept getting closer. His heart felt like it was going to burst and his head felt dizzy. Suddenly a wet hand yanked from behind. He screamed but something covered his mouth before it could come out. He soon realized it was Layna. She had pulled him into an outcrop in the cave. A big shape whipped past them in the dark. Something whizzed barely a hair over his head. They heard the sounds of slapping feet and muffled breathing go past them. As soon as the sounds began to fade. Layna lit the torch. Her eyes were wide with terror, but her face was full of determination.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “We can’t keep going the way we got in because it will be waiting for us. We can’t assume it will just leave once it reaches the entrance. It might even circle back looking for us. It can be crafty sometimes. I’ve only ever seen it once before, but never this close. If it catches you it drags you back to its place in the mountain. I don’t know what it does to things that get taken there, but they never come back. I think we can use the rope to climb out of the ceiling in the cavern.”
                    “How will we get it up?” Asked Jon.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “We can hook it on one of the mirrors that let light into the cavern. It might be our only chance at escape.” David considered their options and quickly agreed with her conclusion. He nodded in agreement and they took off running back into the tunnel.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    They reached the cavern and ran straight to the center. They heard a faint screech from far in the tunnel.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “It must have figured out we didn’t leave the tunnel. It probably saw there were only two sets of footprints leading into the tunnel and none leading out.” Said Layna uncoiling the rope. She tied a rock to one end of the rope.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I hope you can throw it farther than I can,” She said handing Jon the rope “It’s farther than I thought it was.” Another shriek came from the tunnel. It had turned around. The second shriek was louder. Jon swung the rope around his head and let it go. It fell just short. He tried again, this time just a little too much to the right. He tried again this time it went over. He grabbed the end with a rock and tied it to the closest pillar. Layna grabbed the other side and started climbing with Jon right on her heels.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    They began making their way up the rope when the beast burst from the cave entrance into the cavern. It began moving towards them. Its arms flailed in every direction as it moved towards them. They started climbing faster. The beast flailed for the rope furiously. Its wails echoed in the cavern halls.

                    The beast began shaking the rope, the two were almost at the top, and the beast stopped shaking the rope and its body started creaking. The beast started explosively climbing the rope. Layna had made it to the top and was right on her heels. The best ripped up the rope with terrifying ease. Just as Jon was grabbing for the mirror he felt a wet hand grab his leg harshly. Fingernails dug into his leg. He cried out in pain. The beast began pulling on him, trying to yank him off the rope. Jon gripped the rope till his knuckles turned white, crying out in pain. Layna reach down and pulled the hatchet from his back and in one swift movement threw it over Jon’s head.
                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    The head of the hatchet sunk deep into the beast’s face. The beast made a gargling sound and let go of the rope it fell, but quickly latched on to the rope again and began climbing back up furiously. Layna grabbed Jon’s hand and pulled him up. The beast was furiously climbing the rope. Jon grabbed the torch from Layna and set the rope on fire. The beast scrambled up the rope but just before it could reach the top the rope snapped and it fell to the ground. They both looked down at the beast hoping it was dead. The beast’s arms began to twist as its body groaned and pop. The beast slowly backed into the shadows heading towards the entrance. The two children scrambled through the hole in the ceiling and into a patch of grass on top of a hill.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    They barely had time to enjoy the fresh air, before Layna started to run down the hill in the direction of the mine entrance.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “What are you doing?” Cried Jon, not sure what he should do. His feet decided to start running after her.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “We can beat it to the entrance and burn the support beams trapping it inside.”
                    “Yeah, that’s IF we can beat it.” Said Jon in between gasps of air. His legs continued to run after her through his disagreement.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    They sprinted their way to the bottom of the hill, their faces flush from exhaustion. They ran towards the mine’s entrance. They stood at the entrance of the cave staring deep into the darkness of the mine. Jon grabbed the torch and started burning the support beams. The cold coming from the cave grew stronger till they could start seeing their breath. The fire spread to the beams within the cave.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “We should run.” Said Jon.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “We need to make sure it’s trapped. If we leave now we may never know.”
                    They heard the sound of wet hands slapping against the wall. By now the fire had spread deep within the tunnel. They stared past the fire into the darkness. Suddenly they could see a shape moving towards them into the darkness. Jon ran into the tunnel and started pushing on the beams. The shape began moving faster, dropping to all fours like a wild animal. Jon pushed with all his might but the support for the cave wouldn’t move.

                    The fire burned around him and the beast grew closer and closer. Suddenly he felt Layna press up next to him and begin pushing. The two groaned in agony till they started to feel the beam move. With one final push, the beam collapsed. The other beams started groaning and the sound of splintering wood mixed with the sounds of flames. The two children bolted out of the tunnel as the cave began collapsing around them. The monster shrieked and was silenced by the sounds of falling rocks. The two children fell to the ground gasping for breath, their hearts pounding out of their chests.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The two children used the oil from the torch to paint a sign. It read; Danger! Cave closed. The two children set up the sign on the pile of rocks. They looked at each other and laughed in relief. Layna laughed till she cried. Jon was so full of relief he dropped to the ground. The two children soaked up the moment while they could.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    After a short time, the two composed themselves. They started walking back down the trail and into the woods. After a short while, they saw two silhouettes walking toward them. Jon squinted his eyes till he made the shape of his younger brother David. He had never been so relieved to see his younger brother. He took off running towards him.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    David had been walking with the fox for a few hours until out of nowhere he saw his brother running towards him. Jonathan ran straight up to him and picked him up into a giant bear hug, swinging him around and laughing. David looked his brother in the eyes and joined him in laughter.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Layna, this is my brother David. David this is Layna, and you must be Mr. Foxwell?” Said Jon as he looked at the fox.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Layna butted in before he could say anything. “That is not Mr. Foxwell. That is his cousin Lucious, but many call him Lucifer because of the many tricks he plays. Lucious grinned and rubbed the back of his head.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “What can I say, a fox has gotta make a living.” Said Lucious. “Now my dear Layna. I got your message and delivered the boy. I’d say that makes us even.”
                    “You disgust me.” Said Layna staring holes into Lucious. He just grinned.
                    “Come on, fairs fair!” Said Lucious. “I did you this solid, but not for free, so let me hear it.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Fine, you’re a scum bag, but your debts are forgiven.” Said Layna through her teeth.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Well then, I guess I’ll just be on my way then!” In a flash, Lucious disappeared.
                    Jon reached into his pocket and realized the jar was not there. He patted his pockets but there was nothing. David reached for his bag but there was nothing there. Jon realized

                    “Well, that is truly bothersome.” Said David.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The three of them walked back through the forest. They reached the collapsed bridge. Jonathan grabbed a log and the three of them hoisted it onto the bridge Jon quickly scrambled to the other side. Layna and David crossed after him. David with a little bit of hesitancy. They continued to walk through the forest.
                    “Layna, it now occurs to me that I never asked where you are from.” Said Jon.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “I live here in the forest. Mr. Foxwell looks after me when I need it, but I seldom need it. I live in that tower mostly. I figured I’d accompany you two and make sure you both make it home safe and sound.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Thank you!” Chimed David.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “You mean you live in the deep forest?”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Yes,” said Layna flatly, as if it wasn’t a big deal. “I am writing a book about the deep forest and recording strange happenings within the forest.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Wow.” Said Jon and David in unison.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The two of them walked in silence as David sang songs and whistled melodies. They walked until they reached the edge of the woods and they all stopped. Waiting for them was a basket full of berries and a jar of salt. Pinned to the basket was a note that said
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Sorry I didn’t get a chance to meet you, hopefully, we can meet soon.”
                    -Love Foxwell
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Why don’t you come and have Sunday soup with us?” Jon said to Layna.
                    “I couldn’t poss–” Layna tried to get out.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    “Great! We’ll expect you every Sunday, that way you can keep us updated on everything that happens deep in the woods.”
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Layna smiled and accepted. The three walked back to the house, greeted by the sweet smell of soup. David to this day says it was the best soup he had ever had.
