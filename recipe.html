    <h3>instructions</h3>    

    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the seasoning mixture:
     In a small bowl, stir together the chili powder, garlic powder, 
     onion powder, dried oregano, paprika, ground cumin and 1 teaspoon
     salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.  Stir. </p>

    <p>Peel the sweet potatoes and chop into bite-sized chunks. Toss the
    potatoes with 3 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon + 2 
    teaspoons of the seasoning mixture. Toss together with your 
    hands until well coated and then bake for 15 minutes. Remove 
    from the oven, toss around and return for another 15 minutes. 
    Remove, toss around and if needed cook for another 5-10 minutes
    or until sweet potatoes are tender. Remove the tray and add the 
    drained & rinsed black beans, drained corn, and 1 more teaspoon
    of the seasoning mixture. Toss everything on the tray (The beans
    and corn will get warm on the hot tray).</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, make cilantro lime rice or quinoa: Bring 2 cups of
    water to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the butter and 
    rice (or quinoa) and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low,
    cover, and simmer until the rice (or quinoa) is cooked through
    and tender. Stir in the lime juice, lime zest, cilantro, and 
    salt + pepper to taste.</p>

    <p>Make the sauce: combine the sour cream, lime zest & 3 tablespoons
    freshly squeezed lime juice, Cholula hot sauce, and 1/2 to 1 
    full tablespoon* of the remaining spice mixture (or add the spice
    mixture to personal preference). Whisk until smooth.</p>

    <P>Assemble: in bowls or on plates, add the rice as a base. Top with 
    sweet potatoes, corn, & black bean mixture. Add your other desired 
    toppings such as avocado, tomatoes, and additional cilantro. Drizzle 
    the sauce over or serve as a side. Squeeze on some fresh lime and 
    enjoy immediately!</P>
